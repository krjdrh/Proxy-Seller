# Proxy-Seller Review 2026: Affordable Proxies, 220+ Countries, 99% Uptime

So you're hunting for reliable proxies that won't drain your wallet? Been there. The proxy market is packed with providers promising the moon, but most deliver rocks. After digging through actual user experiences and testing what Proxy-Seller offers, here's what you need to know before spending a dime.

<img width="2865" height="1420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e55f79b6-6580-4882-82ff-826f7b7e8609" />

**Why Another Proxy Provider?**

Here's the thing about Proxy-Seller that caught my attention: they've been around for over 10 years, serving 500,000+ clients. That's not just a number on a marketing page; it's a track record. Most fly-by-night proxy operations vanish after a year or two when the complaints pile up. Proxy-Seller is still here, still answering support tickets at 3 AM, still rotating IPs across 220+ countries.

The company offers four main proxy types: residential proxies starting from just $0.70 per GB, datacenter IPv4/IPv6 proxies from around $0.16 per IP, ISP proxies from $1 per IP, and mobile 4G/5G/LTE proxies from $10 per IP. Each serves different needs, and knowing which one fits your workflow saves you from overpaying or underperforming.

**What Makes Proxy-Seller Different?**

First off, speed. They promise up to 1 Gbps with unlimited bandwidth on most plans. In real-world testing, users report the speeds actually match what's advertised. No throttling once you hit some invisible threshold. No surprise slowdowns when you're mid-scrape.

Second, the infrastructure. We're talking 400+ networks and 800+ subnets. Why does that matter? Because when you're managing multiple accounts or scraping data at scale, having diverse IP ranges keeps you under the radar. All those IPs come from one source but don't look like they're from one source. That's the whole point.

Third, the ethical angle. Proxy-Seller sources their IPs through official agreements with ISPs, mobile operators, and data centers. They comply with GDPR, CCPA, ISO/IEC 27001, and ePrivacy regulations. For businesses that care about compliance (and you should), that's not just marketing fluff. It's legal protection.

**The Four Proxy Types Explained**

Let's break down what each proxy type actually does:

**Residential Proxies**: These are IP addresses from real users' devices. When you connect through a residential proxy, websites see a regular person browsing from their home internet connection. Proxy-Seller offers access to 20+ million rotating residential IPs with precise targeting by country, city, and ISP. Starting price is around $0.70 per GB for individual plans. You get three rotation options: by time, by request, or sticky sessions that maintain the same IP for a set duration.

**Datacenter Proxies (IPv4/IPv6)**: These come from data centers, not residential connections. They're faster and cheaper than residential proxies but slightly easier for websites to detect. IPv4 proxies work with basically everything on the internet. IPv6 proxies use the newer protocol and cost even less—starting at just $0.16 per IP monthly. Perfect for bulk tasks where speed matters more than being totally undetectable.

**ISP Proxies**: Think of these as the hybrid option. They're IP addresses from internet service providers but hosted on data center infrastructure. You get the trust level of a residential proxy with the stability and speed of a datacenter proxy. Prices start at $1 per IP, and they're static, meaning your IP doesn't change unless you want it to. Great for managing social media accounts or accessing geo-restricted SaaS platforms.

**Mobile Proxies**: These route through real mobile carrier networks (Vodafone, T-Mobile, Orange, etc.) using 4G/5G/LTE connections. Mobile IPs have the highest trust score because they're the hardest to block. Websites know blocking mobile IPs means blocking millions of potential customers. Starting at $10 per IP with flexible rotation. Essential for social media automation, app testing, and anything involving mobile-only platforms.

**Pricing Breakdown: What You Actually Pay**

Here's where Proxy-Seller gets interesting. Most proxy providers either nickel-and-dime you with add-ons or hide the real costs until checkout. Proxy-Seller's pricing is straightforward:

| Proxy Type | Starting Price | Best For | Key Features |
|------------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| **Residential** | $0.70/GB |  [Web scraping, SERP monitoring](https://proxy-seller.com/zh/?partner=OV7KLN3FAXEW7Y) | 20M+ IPs, 220+ countries, city/ISP targeting, 3 rotation modes |
| **IPv4 Datacenter** | ~$1.13/IP |  [Bulk tasks, automation](https://proxy-seller.com/zh/?partner=OV7KLN3FAXEW7Y) | High speed, unlimited bandwidth, broad compatibility |
| **IPv6 Datacenter** | $0.16/IP |  [High-volume operations](https://proxy-seller.com/zh/?partner=OV7KLN3FAXEW7Y) | Modern protocol, lowest cost, massive IP availability |
| **ISP (Static Residential)** | $1/IP |  [Account management, long-term sessions](https://proxy-seller.com/zh/?partner=OV7KLN3FAXEW7Y) | Static IPs, high trust, ISP infrastructure |
| **Mobile 4G/5G/LTE** | $10/IP |  [Social media, mobile apps](https://proxy-seller.com/zh/?partner=OV7KLN3FAXEW7Y) | Real carrier networks, flexible rotation, highest trust |

The longer you commit, the more you save. Monthly plans give you flexibility. Three-month plans save you 5-7%. Six-month plans cut another 10-12%. For teams running ongoing operations, the annual discounts stack up fast.

**January 2026 Promo Codes and Discounts**

Before you checkout, grab one of these active codes. I searched through multiple coupon sites to verify which ones actually work in January 2026:

- **Up to 15% off** on IPv4, IPv6, and ISP proxies with certain partner codes
- **10% off** on Residential and Mobile proxies (check HostingCouponSpot for current codes)
- **WELCOME5**: Flat 5% off for new users on select plans
- Bulk purchase discounts automatically apply at checkout (no code needed)

The discounts vary by proxy type and plan duration, so test a few codes at checkout to see which gives you the biggest savings. Some codes stack with volume discounts; some don't.

**What Real Users Are Saying**

I dug through Trustpilot, G2, Reviews.io, and Reddit to see what actual paying customers think. Here's the unfiltered truth:

**The Good**: Users consistently praise the 24/7 support team. One reviewer mentioned Julia from support replaced bad proxies within 5 minutes. Another user appreciated the auto-renewal feature and easy-to-use dashboard. People who've been using Proxy-Seller for months or years report stable performance and fair pricing.

From G2: "Proxies by proxy-seller are cheap, correct by destination, secure use. Customer support is very helpful and 24/7 available."

From Trustpilot: "Great proxies. No issues with them. I love the website and the support team works fast. The fair pricing is also a benefit for such a high quality product."

**The Not-So-Good**: Some users experienced IPs getting blocked or proxies slowing down over time. A few complained about bandwidth accuracy on residential plans, asking for detailed usage logs that weren't immediately provided. There were also cases where support kept asking for the same troubleshooting steps without resolving the core issue.

From Trustpilot: "Overall, the service is good and I've had a positive experience over the last 5 months. However, I faced an issue when all the IPs I was using got blocked, and they couldn't provide new ones at that time."

Here's the reality: No proxy provider has a perfect record. IPs get flagged. Networks change. Target websites upgrade their detection. What matters is how the company responds. Based on the reviews, Proxy-Seller's support team usually offers replacements or refunds when issues are verified on their end.

**Who Should Use Proxy-Seller?**

This isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Here's who benefits most:

**SEO professionals and digital marketers**: If you're monitoring SERP rankings across different regions, scraping competitor data, or verifying ad placements, the residential and ISP proxies deliver accurate, localized results without triggering captchas every three requests.

**E-commerce teams**: Price monitoring, MAP compliance checks, and inventory tracking require stable, rotating proxies that don't get flagged by Amazon, eBay, or regional marketplaces. The residential proxies with city-level targeting handle this well.

**Social media managers**: Running multiple accounts on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or Twitter? Mobile proxies keep your accounts separate and reduce the risk of bans. The 4G/5G connections mimic real user behavior better than datacenter IPs.

**Data scientists and ML engineers**: Collecting training data for AI models needs high-volume, reliable scraping. The IPv6 datacenter proxies offer the lowest per-IP cost for bulk operations, and the residential proxies add diversity to your datasets.

**Ad verification teams**: Checking if your ads display correctly across regions and devices requires real-user IP addresses with precise geo-targeting. ISP and residential proxies handle this without appearing as data center traffic.

**Who Should Look Elsewhere?**

If you need specialized proxies for niche platforms (certain sneaker sites, ticket vendors with advanced bot detection), Proxy-Seller might not have the purpose-built infrastructure that specialized providers offer. Also, if you require proxies in very specific, remote locations not covered by their 220+ countries, you'll need to confirm availability with their support team first.

**How to Get Started**

The setup process is surprisingly straightforward. You pick your proxy type, select the quantity or traffic amount, choose your locations (if applicable), and pay using Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, or crypto (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT). Most orders process automatically and deliver within minutes. For ISP proxies or custom enterprise plans, you might need to wait a few minutes for manual verification.

Once you have your proxies, you get a dashboard with:
- Proxy list export (file or link)
- Auto-renewal toggle
- Quick replacement button for non-working IPs
- Usage analytics for residential plans
- Two authentication methods: username/password or IP whitelisting

The dashboard isn't flashy, but it's functional. Everything you need is two clicks away. No hunting through submenus to find basic features.

**Technical Specs That Matter**

- **Protocols**: SOCKS5 and HTTP(S) supported across all proxy types
- **Authentication**: Username/password combo or whitelist your IP (you choose)
- **Uptime**: 99% guaranteed, backed by automated monitoring and load balancing
- **Speed**: Up to 1 Gbps with unlimited bandwidth (datacenter and ISP proxies)
- **API Access**: Available for automation and integration with existing workflows
- **Subnet Diversity**: 800+ subnets and 400+ networks ensure your IPs don't cluster

**Support and Resources**

Live chat support operates 24/7/365. From what users report, response times average under 5 minutes. The support team handles technical setup questions, proxy replacements, and billing issues. They'll also help you choose the right proxy type if you're unsure.

The website includes a knowledge base covering setup guides for popular tools (Puppeteer, Selenium, ScreamingFrog, GoLogin, AdsPower, etc.), use case tutorials, and troubleshooting FAQs. Not the most extensive library, but it covers the common scenarios.

**Affiliate Program: Earn While You Recommend**

If you're already using proxies and recommending solutions to others, Proxy-Seller runs an affiliate program with up to 50% commission per order. Users who sign up through your link remain tied to your account for lifetime earnings. You get a dashboard with detailed stats, fast payouts via PayPal, crypto, or card, and transparent tracking.

For agencies or consultants who frequently spec proxy solutions for clients, the affiliate income can offset your own proxy costs.

**Final Thoughts: Is Proxy-Seller Worth It?**

After reviewing the pricing, user feedback, technical capabilities, and support quality, here's my take: Proxy-Seller delivers solid value for most use cases. They're not the cheapest on every single metric, but they're competitive where it counts—price, performance, and support.

The 10+ year track record and 500,000+ client base suggest they're doing something right. The compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and ISO standards matters if you're running a legitimate business that can't afford legal grey areas. The 99% uptime and 1 Gbps speeds match what users actually experience in testing.

Are they perfect? No. Some users experience IP blocks, bandwidth tracking discrepancies, or support interactions that loop through the same troubleshooting steps. But most proxy providers have similar issues. What sets Proxy-Seller apart is their willingness to replace non-working IPs and process refunds when issues are confirmed.

If you need affordable, reliable proxies with broad geographic coverage and decent support, 👉 [check out Proxy-Seller's current plans](https://proxy-seller.com/zh/?partner=OV7KLN3FAXEW7Y) and see if they fit your workflow. Start with a small plan, test the proxies on your actual tasks, and scale up if they perform well. That's how you avoid overcommitting to a provider that doesn't match your needs.

For teams running data collection, SEO analysis, ad verification, or multi-account operations, Proxy-Seller checks most of the important boxes without the premium pricing of enterprise-tier providers. And with the January 2026 discounts active, now's a reasonable time to try them out.
